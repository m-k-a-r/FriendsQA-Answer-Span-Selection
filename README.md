# FriendsQA-Answer-Span-Selection

## Instructions

The notebook is to be run as any python notebook.

It is sectioned into 5 parts: Data, Data Analysis, BERT, Fine-Tuned BERT and Bi-LSTM. Each model section contains its own dataloaders. 

Please note that the data analysis part requires the SQuAD 1.1 training dataset which is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. It has been uploaded to the shared drive for NLP243 2022 projects. Nevertheless, it can be accessed here: https://deepai.org/dataset/squad

Each part of the notebook is further labeled and commented for ease of understanding. 

If running this notebook on Colab, please make sure to upload all the data to the files section of Colab such that data path is /content/data_file_name.json. The data has to be in the same directory as the notebook for anywhere else.
